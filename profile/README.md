EPIC Erebus is a a tiny PCIe DMA tool that's fully customizable with an open toolchain and gateware

We've been brainstorming on Erebus for over a decade. Right now, we've got prototype hardware and lots of plans, and we're ready to start showing off our progress. We'll start posting designs here once they achieve a minimum level of functionality - we don't want to post things that have the potential to damage your tools and devices.

We're teasing some details about erebus at DEFCON 33. Info to be posted online at: https://github.com/securelyfitz/DirectMemoryAccessEverywhere

There's a pre-launch page on CrowdSupply. Once we're confident in the utility and durability of the hardware, we'll launch the actual campaign - hopefully in the next few months:

EPIC is an anagram of PCIE; our hope is that Erebus will be the go-to tool to to RE (reverse engineer) the bus on some PCIe Devices.
